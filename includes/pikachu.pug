                        This was one of my first animations using CSS and I had so much fun bringing it to life. My only real requirements for this experiment were to create an animation in CSS only and make it responsive. #[br]#[br]I am using media queries to resize Pikachu based on the screen width however my next version will be using CSS variables.
        include ./footer.pug
    script(src='./script.js')
