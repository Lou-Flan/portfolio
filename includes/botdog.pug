                    Due to little time, small city homes and many offices not allowing pets at work, many developers miss out on having a pet dog. #[span BotDog is a Tamagotchi style game], written in Ruby and executed from the command line giving users a pet dog to feed, pat and play with.

                    #[br]#[br]Be warned... BotDog says he is the best behaved boy but he has a habit of going to the toilet in the terminal.
